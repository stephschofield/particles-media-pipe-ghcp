## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Configure particle distribution for face landmarks with very tight clustering at 1-2 pixels for a dense mesh effect. Boost depth influence for nose, cheekbones, and eye sockets so facial features pop out in 3D.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Face particles clustered at 1-2px spread
- [ ] #2 Nose particles pushed forward with depth boost
- [ ] #3 Cheekbone particles show prominence
- [ ] #4 Eye socket particles recessed for depth
- [ ] #5 Dense mesh effect creates recognizable face shape
- [ ] #6 468 landmarks properly weighted for distribution
<!-- AC:END -->
