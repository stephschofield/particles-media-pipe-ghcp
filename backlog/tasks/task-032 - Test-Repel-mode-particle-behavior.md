## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Verify that particles push away from hand and face landmarks in Repel mode
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Particles move away from landmarks when hand approaches
- [ ] #2 Repulsion creates visible 'bubble' around hand/face
- [ ] #3 Particles return when hand moves away
- [ ] #4 Mode toggle button shows 'Repel' label clearly
- [ ] #5 Switching from Attract to Repel shows immediate behavior change
<!-- AC:END -->
