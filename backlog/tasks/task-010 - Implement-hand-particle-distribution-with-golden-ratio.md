## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Configure particle distribution for hands using golden ratio math for organic spread. Taper the spread so fingertips are narrow (1-2px), finger segments are medium, and palm areas are wider for natural hand shapes.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Golden ratio (phi) used for particle spiral distribution
- [ ] #2 Fingertip particles clustered in narrow 1-2px spread
- [ ] #3 Finger segment particles at medium spread
- [ ] #4 Palm area particles at widest spread
- [ ] #5 Smooth transitions between spread zones
- [ ] #6 Distribution follows bone structure naturally
