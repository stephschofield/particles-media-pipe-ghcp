## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Optimize the entire system for smooth 60fps performance with 15,000 particles. Profile and optimize bottlenecks in particle physics, rendering, and MediaPipe processing. Test across different devices.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Maintains 60fps with 15,000 particles
- [ ] #2 No frame drops during hand/face detection
- [ ] #3 Memory usage stays stable over time
- [ ] #4 Works on mid-range hardware
- [ ] #5 Profiling identifies no major bottlenecks
- [ ] #6 GPU acceleration utilized where possible
