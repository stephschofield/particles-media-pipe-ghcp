## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Verify that particles move toward hand and face landmarks in Attract mode with correct physics
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Particles visibly accelerate toward detected landmarks
- [ ] #2 Attraction feels natural (not instant teleportation)
- [ ] #3 Particles cluster more densely at landmark centers
- [ ] #4 Hand movement causes particles to follow smoothly
- [ ] #5 Mode toggle button shows 'Attract' label clearly
