It is very important to me that the end result looks like these screenshots: back box simulated background, hand and facial movements of particles are aligned and tracked exactly with what the camera is showing, attract mode is a toggle on the top left, and 2 hands is shown when I present both hands vs 1 hand when i am only showing one. I want the particles to only be presented for my hands and face, no other explosions/disparate particles elsewhere. I want the particle models of my hands and face to appear larger when I get closer to the camera. Essentially, the particles should be an exact clone of what I am doing on camera, so speed/latency is absolutely critical. Please use UX design and product strategy and developer to determine how this can be done effectively
